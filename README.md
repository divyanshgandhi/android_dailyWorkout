# Another project in the series of Android.

The more and more I got into taking care of myself, and staying fit, I wanted to keep track of my ongoing activities.
I started my workouts with the 100 pushup challenge daily. So, to keep track of that I made this app which dpes just tat. 

I am slowly gonna add more features and more excercises. So, if you feel you want to help with that clone the code and contribute to it. I'll be happy to accept a pull request. 

Future (possible) upgrades :
- Pushup animation
- Daily record
- Pushups as high score, beating it everyday
- Monthly record
- Sharing your progress
- Social features (compete with each other, etc..)
- Planks
- Bicep curls
